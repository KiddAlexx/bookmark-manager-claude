# SPEC.md — Bookmark Manager App

## Overview

A full-stack bookmark manager application built to the Frontend Mentor Figma specification.
Users can save, organize, search, filter, sort, pin, archive, and visit web bookmarks.
The app supports light/dark themes, is fully responsive, and persists data across devices via
authenticated user accounts.

The project is built in three phases:

- **Phase 1:** Full UI with local JSON seed data, no auth, no database
- **Phase 2:** Auth, Postgres database, image hosting, metadata auto-fetch, duplicate detection
- **Phase 3:** Browser extension, keyboard shortcuts, testing, final polish

---

## Version Philosophy

Prefer **modern but settled** versions with strong ecosystem compatibility. Do not adopt the
newest major release purely because it is newest. Use current stable releases within a mature
version line unless there is a clear project-specific reason to go newer.

If a version decision changes during implementation, the reason must be documented in
`/experiment/decisions.md`.

## Data Models

### Bookmark

```ts
interface Bookmark {
  id: string
  userId: string                 // Phase 2+
  title: string
  description: string
  url: string
  normalizedUrl: string          // For duplicate detection
  tags: string[]
  favicon: string | null         // Cloudinary URL (Phase 2) or Google Favicon API URL (Phase 1)
  viewCount: number
  lastVisited: string | null     // ISO date string
  dateAdded: string              // ISO date string
  isPinned: boolean
  isArchived: boolean
}
```

### User (Phase 2+)

```ts
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  avatarUrl: string | null       // Cloudinary URL
  createdAt: string
}
```

---

## Requirements Breakdown

### 1. Bookmark CRUD

**Add bookmark**
- Fields: title (required), URL (required), description (optional), tags (optional)
- On URL entry: auto-fetch metadata (title, description, favicon) via server-side API route
- Favicon uploaded to Cloudinary (Phase 2) or fetched from Google Favicon API (Phase 1)
- Duplicate detection: warn if normalized URL already exists for this user
- Manual favicon upload as fallback (file input)

**Edit bookmark**
- Same form as Add, pre-filled with existing data
- Metadata re-fetch available if URL is changed

**Archive bookmark**
- Sets `isArchived = true`
- Removes from main view, appears in Archive view
- If bookmark is pinned, silently unpin on archive

**Delete bookmark**
- Permanent removal — separate from archive
- Confirmation prompt before delete to prevent accidental loss

**View bookmark detail**
- Full data: favicon (large), title, URL, description, all tags, view count, last visited, date added
- Visit URL action (opens new tab, increments viewCount, sets lastVisited)
- Copy URL to clipboard

---

### 2. UI Sections

#### Header / Navbar
- App logo
- Search bar (real-time title search)
- Theme toggle (light / dark)
- User avatar + account menu (Phase 2)
- Add bookmark button

#### Sidebar
- Full list of all unique tags across user's bookmarks
- Multi-select tag filter (OR logic — any match)
- Active/selected state per tag
- Reset / All option to clear all active filters
- Archive view navigation link
- Responsive: collapses on mobile (exact behavior from Figma)

#### Main Bookmark List
- Pinned section at top (labeled, visually separate)
- Regular bookmarks below
- Sort control: Recently added | Recently visited | Most visited
- Empty states:
  - No bookmarks yet
  - No results for current search query
  - No results for current tag filter combination

#### Bookmark Card

Displays:
- Favicon (with fallback icon for missing/broken images)
- Title
- URL (truncated)
- Description (truncated)
- Tags as pills/chips
- Date added

Actions (on hover or via overflow menu — match Figma exactly):
- Pin / Unpin
- Archive
- Edit
- Copy URL (with "Copied!" feedback for ~2 seconds)
- Visit URL (opens new tab)
- Delete

States:
- Default
- Pinned (visual indicator)
- Hover
- Focus (keyboard navigation)

#### Add / Edit Modal
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Fields: title, URL, description, tags, favicon
- URL blur → triggers metadata auto-fetch (title, description, favicon pre-populated)
- Favicon: displays fetched image with option to re-upload manually
- Tag input: inline add/remove tags
- Validation errors shown inline per field
- Loading state during metadata fetch
- Accessible: focus trap, ESC to close, aria-modal

#### Archive View
- All bookmarks where `isArchived === true`
- Unarchive action per item
- Delete action per item
- Empty state when no archived items
- Accessible via sidebar navigation link

#### Bookmark Detail View
- Full display of all bookmark fields
- Actions: visit, copy, edit, archive, delete
- Implementation: modal or route — confirm from Figma before Step 9

#### User Profile / Settings (Phase 2)
- Display name edit
- Avatar upload via Cloudinary
- Account management

#### Auth Pages (Phase 2)
- Login: OAuth (Google, GitHub) + email/password
- Register
- Forgot password

---

### 3. Interactions

| Interaction | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Type in search bar | Filters bookmark list by title in real-time, case-insensitive |
| Click tag in sidebar | Adds tag to active filter set |
| Click active tag | Removes tag from active filter set |
| Click Reset / All | Clears all active tag filters |
| Click sort option | Re-sorts the visible filtered list |
| Click pin | Toggles isPinned; moves card to/from pinned section |
| Click archive | Sets isArchived = true; removes from main view |
| Click unarchive | Sets isArchived = false; returns to main view |
| Click edit | Opens modal pre-filled with bookmark data |
| Click copy URL | Copies to clipboard; button shows "Copied!" for 2 seconds |
| Click visit | Opens URL in new tab; increments viewCount; sets lastVisited |
| Click delete | Confirmation prompt; permanently removes bookmark |
| Submit add/edit form | Validates → fetches metadata if needed → saves → closes modal |
| Blur URL field in form | Triggers metadata fetch; pre-fills title/description/favicon |
| Toggle theme | Switches light/dark; persists to localStorage (Phase 1) / user record (Phase 2) |
| Upload favicon | Uploads to Cloudinary (Phase 2); updates favicon field |

---

### 4. Filter + Search + Sort Composition

- Search: case-insensitive substring match on `title`
- Tag filter: OR logic — show bookmarks matching **any** selected tag
- Search and tag filter compose — both must match simultaneously
- Sort applies to the composed filtered result set
- Pinned bookmarks shown in their own section above, also subject to search/filter
- Archived bookmarks never appear in main view regardless of filters
- All composition computed via `useMemo` — never stored in state

---

### 5. Duplicate Detection

- On URL entry in the Add form, normalize the URL:
  - Lowercase
  - Strip trailing slash
  - Strip `www.`
  - Strip protocol (`https://`, `http://`)
- Check normalized URL against existing bookmarks for this user
- If match found: show non-blocking warning with link to existing bookmark
- User can dismiss warning and save anyway (intentional duplicates allowed)
- Database enforces unique constraint on `(userId, normalizedUrl)` as hard safety net (Phase 2)
- Duplicate detection must be enforced server-side — client check is UX only
- Normalization utility lives in `/src/lib/utils/url.ts`, shared between client and server

---

### 6. Metadata Auto-fetch

Server-side Route Handler at `POST /api/metadata`:
- Accepts `{ url: string }`
- Fetches the target URL server-side (bypasses browser CORS)
- Parses HTML with Cheerio
- Extracts in priority order:
  - Title: `og:title` → `<title>` → URL hostname as fallback
  - Description: `og:description` → `meta[name=description]` → empty string
  - Favicon: `<link rel="icon">` → `<link rel="shortcut icon">` → `/favicon.ico`
- Phase 2: downloads favicon and uploads to Cloudinary; returns Cloudinary URL
- Phase 1: returns raw favicon URL directly
- Returns `{ title, description, faviconUrl }`
- Error handling: if fetch fails, returns empty fields gracefully — user fills manually
- Metadata fetch failures must degrade gracefully and never block the save flow

---

### 7. Theme

- Two modes: light and dark
- Tailwind v4 dark mode via `class` on `<html>` element
- All color tokens defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css`
- Phase 1: preference persisted to `localStorage`
- Phase 2: preference persisted to user record in DB, synced across devices
- Default: system preference via `prefers-color-scheme`, fallback to light

---

### 8. Keyboard Shortcuts (Phase 3)

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `N` | Open new bookmark modal |
| `/` or `Cmd+K` | Focus search bar |
| `Escape` | Close modal / clear search |
| `A` | Navigate to Archive view |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Switch sort mode |
| `P` | Pin/unpin focused bookmark |
| `?` | Open keyboard shortcuts help modal |

Implementation: `useKeyboardShortcuts` hook using `keydown` event listener.
Shortcuts disabled when focus is inside an `<input>` or `<textarea>`.

---

### 9. Browser Extension (Phase 3)

Built with WXT (Manifest V3, Chrome + Firefox) in `/extension` directory within the monorepo.

**Features:**
- Popup showing current page title and URL
- One-click save to bookmark manager
- Auto-fills title and URL; triggers metadata fetch via app API
- Requires user to be authenticated (token stored in extension storage)
- Visual confirmation on successful save
- Duplicate warning if URL already saved

**Architecture rules:**
- Extension calls `POST /api/bookmarks` on the deployed app
- Extension must not reimplement bookmark business logic — it delegates to the backend
- Extension must not bypass backend auth or validation rules
- Auth via session token stored in `chrome.storage.local`
- Extension remains thin: capture and display only, no business logic ownership

---

### 10. Responsiveness

Three target layouts (exact breakpoints confirmed from Figma):
- **Mobile** (< 640px): Sidebar hidden, accessible via toggle; stacked card layout
- **Tablet** (640px–1024px): Sidebar collapsible overlay or narrow rail
- **Desktop** (> 1024px): Full sidebar + main content side by side

All interactive elements must meet minimum 44×44px touch target size on mobile.

---

### 11. Accessibility

- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Focus-visible styles on all interactive elements (never `outline: none` without replacement)
- ARIA labels on all icon-only buttons
- Modal: focus trap, `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` pointing to modal title
- Dynamic regions: `aria-live` for search result count, copy feedback, validation errors
- Semantic HTML: `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<button>`, `<form>`, `<label>`
- Sufficient color contrast in both light and dark themes
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for all transitions and animations

---

### 12. Testing Strategy

Testing is a required part of the implementation, not optional polish.

#### Unit Tests (Vitest)

Cover all shared logic and utilities:

| Area | What to Test |
|---|---|
| URL normalization | All normalization rules, edge cases, trailing slashes, www, protocol stripping |
| Duplicate detection | Match, no match, case differences, protocol differences |
| Search/filter/sort logic | All sort modes, OR tag logic, search composition, edge cases |
| Archive/pin behaviors | State transitions, pin + archive conflict resolution |
| Metadata extraction helpers | Title/description/favicon priority order, fallback behavior |

#### Component Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)

Cover interactive UI components:

| Component | What to Test |
|---|---|
| BookmarkCard | Renders all fields, action buttons fire correct callbacks |
| AddEditBookmarkForm | Validation errors, URL blur triggers metadata fetch, tag add/remove |
| TagFilter (Sidebar) | Single select, multi-select, reset clears all |
| SortControl | Each option dispatches correct sort action |
| Modal | Focus trap, ESC closes, aria attributes present |
| ThemeToggle | Toggles class on html element, persists to localStorage |

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Cover critical user flows:

| Flow | Scope |
|---|---|
| Add bookmark | Fill form → submit → appears in list |
| Edit bookmark | Open existing → change title → save → updated in list |
| Archive bookmark | Archive from card → disappears from main → appears in archive |
| Search | Type query → list filters → clear → list restored |
| Tag filter | Select tag → list filters → reset → list restored |
| Duplicate detection | Add URL → add same URL → warning shown |
| Theme toggle | Toggle → class applied → persists on reload |
| Auth flow (Phase 2) | Login → protected route accessible → logout → redirected |

#### Testing Rules
- Tests live alongside source files: `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`
- E2E tests live in `/e2e/`
- Tests for shared utilities must pass before Phase 2 begins
- Component tests for core UI must pass before Phase 2 begins
- E2E tests for critical flows added incrementally from Step 6 onward
- No step is considered done if it breaks existing passing tests

## Service Abstraction Layer

All data access goes through `/src/lib/services/`:

```
/src/lib/services/
  bookmarks.ts     ← getBookmarks, addBookmark, editBookmark, archiveBookmark, deleteBookmark
  user.ts          ← getUser, updateUser (Phase 2)
```

**Phase 1:** functions read/write localStorage, seed from data.json on first load
**Phase 2:** functions call Drizzle ORM queries against Neon Postgres

Zustand store only calls the service layer — never touches localStorage or DB directly.
The web app backend and domain layer is the source of truth.
Phase 1 → Phase 2 migration only touches the service layer files — the rest of the app is unchanged.

---

## Scope Exclusions

The following must not be built unless the specification is intentionally changed:

- Team or shared workspaces
- Social or community features
- AI-generated tagging or summaries
- Bookmark sharing or public profiles
- Browser history ingestion
- Import / export systems
- Native mobile apps
- Analytics beyond required bookmark view count and last visited metadata

Optional enhancements may be noted in `experiment/summary.md` but must not interrupt the core build sequence.

## Implementation Plan

Each step is broken into sub-tasks (a, b, c…). Each sub-task is implemented, reviewed, and committed separately before the next begins.

### Phase 1 — Full UI with Local Data

| Step | Sub-task | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ✅ complete | Project scaffold: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, Lucide, next/font, Vitest + RTL config, folder structure, design tokens from Figma |

| 2b | | Zod schemas (`src/lib/schemas.ts`) derived from types |
| 2c | | URL normalization utility (`src/lib/utils/url.ts`) + unit tests |
| 2d | | localStorage service layer (`src/lib/services/bookmarks.ts`, `user.ts`) + data seeding |
| 3a | | Zustand bookmarkStore: state shape + all actions |
| 3b | | Zustand themeStore: toggle + localStorage persist |
| 4a | | Layout shell: Header component (all breakpoints, search bar, add button) |
| 4b | | Sidebar component: tag list, nav links, desktop layout |
| 4c | | Mobile sidebar drawer + responsive wiring + theme toggle wired |

| 8a | | Archive view: list, unarchive, delete, empty state |
| 8b | | Sidebar archive navigation link wired |
| 9 | | Bookmark detail view: full data display, visit action (confirm modal vs route from Figma first) |
| 10a | | Responsiveness pass: mobile layout + touch targets |
| 10b | | Responsiveness pass: tablet + desktop layout |
| 11a | | Accessibility pass: keyboard nav, ARIA, focus styles |
| 11b | | Accessibility pass: semantic HTML, live regions, motion |
| 12 | | Polish: hover/focus QA, edge cases, visual QA against Figma, full test pass |

### Phase 2 — Auth + Database + Images

| Step | Sub-task | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 13a | | Neon setup + Drizzle schema (users, bookmarks, sessions) |
| 13b | | Migrations + drizzle-zod schema generation |
| 14a | | Auth.js v5: login/register pages + session handling |
| 14b | | Google + GitHub OAuth + protected routes |
| 14c | | Email/password credentials provider |
| 15 | | Migrate service layer from localStorage to Drizzle/Neon |
| 16 | | Metadata API route: Cheerio fetch, title/description/favicon extraction |
| 17a | | Cloudinary: favicon upload pipeline in metadata route |
| 17b | | Cloudinary: avatar upload, secure server-mediated patterns |

| 20 | | Cross-device theme sync: persist to user record in DB |
| 21 | | Phase 2 test pass: auth flow E2E, duplicate detection unit tests, API route tests |

### Phase 3 — Extension + Shortcuts + Final QA

| Step | Sub-task | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 22a | | useKeyboardShortcuts hook + all shortcuts wired |
| 22b | | Keyboard shortcuts help modal + unit tests |
| 23a | | WXT extension scaffold: popup UI |
| 23b | | Extension: save current page action + auth token handling |
| 24 | | Extension: duplicate detection warning, save confirmation, error states |
| 25 | | Extension E2E: core save flow test, duplicate warning test |
| 26 | | Final QA: full regression, extension + main app integration, all tests passing, performance check |

## Risks & Unknowns

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Figma sidebar mobile behavior unclear | Confirm from design before Step 4 |
| Bookmark detail: modal vs route | Confirm from design before Step 9 |
| Tag filter OR vs AND | Assumed OR — verify against brief intent |
| Metadata fetch fails for some URLs | Graceful fallback — empty fields, user fills manually |
| Cheerio cannot parse JS-rendered pages | Acceptable — most sites have static meta tags |
| Cloudinary free tier limits | 25GB storage/bandwidth — sufficient for this scope |
| Pinned + archived conflict | Decision: archiving a pinned bookmark silently unpins it |
| Extension auth flow complexity | Treated as separate sub-project in Phase 3 |
| localStorage 5MB limit in Phase 1 | Store favicon URLs not base64 blobs — text data well within limits |
| Playwright tests in CI | Configure with Vercel preview URLs for E2E against deployed builds |
